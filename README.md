# CV Generator

CV Generator is an Angular 17 app which allows for easy generation of a CV using JSON. This means that it is simple to create a CV and tailor it to specific job roles without creating multiple Word documents.

Styling can be kept the same across different CVs, or you can create your own entire CV "theme" by modifying the HTML and SCSS.

**Creating a CV is now as easy as 123.**

1. Edit the JSON file
2. Run the app
3. Print the page (to PDF or physical copy)

## Creating/Updating your cv

To start creating/updating your CV, simply open up the `src/assets/data.json` file and modify its contents. Run the application and ensure you're happy, and print!

Run `ng serve` to launch the application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Modifying the template

To modify the template of the CV, simply edit the HTML and/or SCSS files to tailor it to your liking. You can even modify the data structure if required and use this as a boilerplate to get started.
